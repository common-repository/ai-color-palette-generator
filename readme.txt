The AI Color Palette plugin assigns a Block Theme's main color scheme using a primary color derived from the logo or another key element

== Description ==
The AI Color Palette plugin sets a Block Theme’s default color palette based on one primary color. Source the primary color from the logo or some other key element.

Why is this important?

Having a well-chosen website color palette is essential for several reasons:

1.  **Brand Identity and Recognition**: Color plays a pivotal role in defining a brand’s identity. A consistent color scheme across your marketing and your website helps create a recognizable brand image, and consistent use of color assures website visitors that they are in the right place.
2.  **User Experience (UX) and Usability**: A good color palette improves the user experience. It can make your website more navigable and the content more readable. Colors draw attention to key elements, separate sections, guide users through your site, and support a visual hierarchy.
3.  **Emotional Connection**: Colors evoke emotions and feelings. Choosing the right color palette can help forge an emotional connection with your audience. For example, blue often instills a sense of trust and professionalism, while green is associated with tranquility and health.
4.  **Visual Appeal**: Aesthetic appeal is crucial for first impressions. An attractive color scheme can make your website more visually appealing, encouraging visitors to stay longer and explore more.
5.  **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Considering color contrast and palette choices can make your website more accessible to people with visual impairments or color blindness. For example, contrast between text and background colors is essential for readability.
6.  **Professionalism and Credibility**: A well-designed website with a harmonious color palette can convey professionalism and credibility, which are essential to building trust with your audience.

The AI Color Palette plugin uses the 60:30:10 color strategy and connects to the Block Theme Style Color settings.

The 60:30:10 color strategy is a widely used guideline in website design. It’s rooted in the principles of interior design and fashion. This strategy involves dividing the color usage in a space—or, in this case, a webpage—into percentages of 60%, 30%, and 10% to create a balanced and visually appealing aesthetic. Here’s how it’s typically applied in website design:

**60%: Primary or Dominant Colors**

-   **Usage**: This color forms the website’s backdrop and is used in approximately 60% of the design. It’s the color that first catches the eye when someone visits the site.
-   **Selection**: Typically, this is a neutral or a subdued hue. Its neutrality and ability to complement other colors set the website’s tone. It should align with the brand’s identity and the site’s target audience.
-   **Examples**: Background colors, large areas like headers, footers, or large sections.

**30%: Secondary Colors**

-   **Usage**: This color is used for about 30% of the design. It supports the primary color and breaks the monotony, adding depth and visual interest.
-   **Selection**: This can be a bit more saturated or bold compared to the primary color. It should contrast yet harmonize with the dominant color. This balance is crucial to avoid color clashes.
-   **Examples**: Navigation bars, subheaders, backgrounds for call-to-action buttons.

**10%: Accent Colors**

-   **Usage**: This is used for the remaining 10% and is typically the boldest color in the palette. It’s used to draw attention to key elements and features.
-   **Selection**: Accent colors contrast strongly with primary and secondary colors, and use is limited. Overuse will lessen their impact and can disrupt the design balance.
-   **Examples**: Highlighted text, icons, CTA buttons, and interactive elements.
